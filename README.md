There's an opportunity to to make their mission statement evolve with time. They can curate relevant content to New Yorkers to improve their lives, specifically by bringing more awareness to health, education, employment, mobility, housing, and income trends.

  - Impact -> Increase in shares on social media leading to subscriptions
  - Risks -> Giving too much focus on certain issues and not on other important ones
  - Limited -> Takes time to investigate and write strong evidence based articles 
  
- Use New York State demographic information to group and distribute content relevant to the different cultures in the New York section. 
  - Impact -> Positive sentiment from educated readers with different backgrounds who feel included
