# The New York Times serves the society and readers by using great journalism to make the reader's life more rich and fulfilling and society more strong and just. 
There's an opportunity to to make their mission statement evolve with time. They can curate relevant content to New Yorkers to improve their lives, specifically by bringing more awareness to health, education, employment, mobility, housing, and income trends. Their ethnical backgrounds are also an indicator of what type of world news they are interested in. New York State has open data of these categories over time. Using this open data, New York Times can identify patterns and bring up talking points such as why has income level not risen in the last decade and write investigative stories on it. This actually serves the society and adds weight to New York Times's mission statement in these changing times.

# Data Sources
https://datausa.io/profile/geo/new-york-ny/ for New York sociodemographic data 

----Below are data that I would look for if I was working for New York Times ----- 
- the most common topics in the New York Section 
- The engagement rates in the different sections of the website
- which type of articles subscribers read the most
- Articles that lead to a subscription
- Where readers are located.
- the type of articles readers enjoy during specific times of day
- Scrape articles with the most shares on social media by other newspapers who cover New York

# Problem

- Content production team reached out to me to see if I could help increse engagement(time spent and pageviews) in the New York section of New York Times website. 
- The real problem is probably that they want daily readership to increase in this section(maybe they're not adhering to their mission statement or promise to readers here) and then use it's relevant appeal to advertise to New Yorkers who are not subscribers.

# Assumptions

- New York Time's target audience are New Yorkers with a bachelor degree or above
- Their audience comes from diverse backgrounds and ethnicities 
- Their audience is interested in politics, and current events in the state and world
- The audience values trust and quality reporting

# Data Problem

- What are current event topics in New York that NYT can investigate based off Open Data sources? 

# Potential Data Solutions

- Identify concerning sociodemographic patterns in New york State that do not meet baseline expectations. Expectations are predicted by machine learning models that uses past data to determine what health costs, pollution levels, or income levels should be at a certain time based off city revenue, demographics, and policies. 
  - Impact -> Increase in daily readerships in New York section because their readers have a place to learn about state issues
  - Risks -> The predictions could be wrong and investigations are costly
  - Limited -> Only given as much data as the government is willing to share

- Identify the social issues that are important to New Yorkers now and write about them using interpreations from state open data and current investigations.
  - Impact -> Increase in pageviews for the given topic. An example was the election, many people turned to New York Times to follow the results.
  - Risks -> Giving too much focus on certain issues and not enough on other important ones
  - Limited -> Takes time to investigate and write strong evidence based articles 
  
- Use New York State demographic information to group and distribute content relevant to the different ethnicities
  - Impact -> Positive sentiment from educated readers
  - Risks -> Spreading content out makes it hard to focus on core New York issues and stories
  - Limited -> Need to hire journalists with different cultural backgrounds

# Action Ideas

- Send journalists to investigate New York City Open Data sociodemographic categories
- Add more content based off New York's ethnic groups

# Impact Hypothesis 

Increase engagement in the New York section of the NYT website by identifying societal interests and sending journalists to investigate and write about them. New Yorkers now have a place to read about state issues that affect their livelihood and society.

Alternative solutions: 

- Invite social New York bloggers to write on the column
- Increase marketing campaigns on this section
- Improve content based on features from popular NYT articles

Risk of Failing:

- New Yorkers are not interested in these topics
- The cost to cover these topics is too expensive. Not worth the benefit for the cost
- The government stops providing this data

Internally & Externally Affected:

- Internally, NYT needs to restructure their content in the New York column requiring teams to discontinue current content production and to focus on the new product.
- Externally, readers might be motivated to act once they are aware of these issues. Government officials would have to adapt and figure out how to address the NYT findings. 

Main Constraint: 

- High budget allocation to investigate and cover so many topics. 

Success Metric:

Daily readership in New York Section increases by 50%. Currently daily readership in this section is low using the current content. Not sure if readers are unaware of this column so they spent most of their reading time on other ones or if this column does not have relevant news articles. 

# Output

The articles written should be part of a larger investigative story on a certain category. Example: Findings on why income level has not risen in the last decade
