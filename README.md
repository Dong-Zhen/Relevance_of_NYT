# The New York Times serves the society and readers by using great journalism to make the reader's life more rich and fulfilling and society more strong and just. 
There's an opportunity to to make their mission statement come true. They can curate relevant content to New Yorkers to improve their lives, specifically by bringing more awareness to health, education, employment, mobility, housing, and income trends. Their ethnical backgrounds are also an indicator of what type of world news they are interested in. New York State has open data of these categories over time. Using this open data, New York Times can identify patterns and bring up talking points such as why has income level not risen in the last decade and write investigative stories on it. This actually serves the society and adds weight to New York Times's mission statement.
