# The New York Times serves the society and readers by using great journalism to make the reader's life more rich and fulfilling and society more strong and just. 
There's an opportunity to increase daily readership of the New York column by make their mission statement relevant with changing times. New York State has open data on health, education, employment, mobility, housing, ethnical backrounds, and income. Over time the data reveals trends that are concerning and needs to be addressed. Because New Yorkers do not have a full scope of how the city uses their resources, New York Times can fill in the gaps by investigating these patterns and explain why this is happening. Their investigations will serve the society and enrich the lives of their readers. 

Lately, the content production team wanted to focus on increasing the time spent and page views in the New York column of the newspaper. They notice that their daily readers are reading other columns, but drop off at the New York column. A EDA of NYT's target market reviews that their audience have a bachelor degree or above and comes from diverse backgrounds. They are interested in current events of the state and world with a touch of arts and music. They value a company's promise to them and quality content. I make the assumption that their readers are curious about state affairs that impact their daily lives. 

# Data Sources
https://datausa.io/profile/geo/new-york-ny/ for New York sociodemographic data 

----Below are data that I would look for if I was working for New York Times ----- 
- the most common topics in the New York Section 
- The engagement rates in the different sections of the website
- which type of articles subscribers read the most
- Articles that lead to a subscription
- Where readers are located.
- the type of articles readers enjoy during specific times of day
- Scrape articles with the most shares on social media by other newspapers who cover New York


# Data Problem

- What are current event topics in New York that NYT can investigate based off Open Data sources? 

# Potential Data Solutions

- Identify concerning sociodemographic patterns in New york State that do not meet baseline expectations. Expectations are predicted by machine learning models that uses past data to determine what health costs, pollution levels, or income levels should be at a certain time based off city revenue, demographics, and policies. 
  - Impact -> Increase in daily readerships in New York section because their readers have a place to learn about state issues
  - Risks -> The predictions could be wrong and investigations are costly
  - Limited -> Only given as much data as the government is willing to share

- Identify the social issues that are important to New Yorkers now and write about them using interpreations from state open data and current investigations.
  - Impact -> Increase in pageviews for the given topic. An example was the election, many people turned to New York Times to follow the results.
  - Risks -> Giving too much focus on certain issues and not enough on other important ones
  - Limited -> Takes time to investigate and write strong evidence based articles 
  
- Use New York State demographic information to group and distribute content relevant to the different ethnicities
  - Impact -> Positive sentiment from educated readers
  - Risks -> Spreading content out makes it hard to focus on core New York issues and stories
  - Limited -> Need to hire journalists with different cultural backgrounds

# Action Ideas

- Send journalists to investigate New York City Open Data sociodemographic categories
- Add more content based off New York's ethnic groups

# Impact Hypothesis 

Increase engagement in the New York section of the NYT website by identifying societal interests and sending journalists to investigate and write about them. New Yorkers now have a place to read about state issues that affect their livelihood and society.

Alternative solutions: 

- Invite social New York bloggers to write on the column
- Increase marketing campaigns on this section
- Improve content based on features from popular NYT articles

Risk of Failing:

- New Yorkers are not interested in these topics
- The cost to cover these topics is too expensive. Not worth the benefit for the cost
- The government stops providing this data

Internally & Externally Affected:

- Internally, NYT needs to restructure their content in the New York column requiring teams to discontinue current content production and to focus on the new product.
- Externally, readers might be motivated to act once they are aware of these issues. Government officials would have to adapt and figure out how to address the NYT findings. 

Main Constraint: 

- High budget allocation to investigate and cover so many topics. 

Success Metric:

Daily readership in New York Section increases by 50%. Currently daily readership in this section is low using the current content. Not sure if readers are unaware of this column so they spent most of their reading time on other ones or if this column does not have relevant news articles. 

# Output

The articles written should be part of a larger investigative story on a certain category. Example: Findings on why income level has not risen in the last decade
