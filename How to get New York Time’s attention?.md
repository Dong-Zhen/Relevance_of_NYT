# According to the U.S. Census, New York has a total population of  20,201,249. The New York Times has 5.26 million paid subscribers in the first quarter of 2021 according to statista.com. Only a small percentage of New Yorkâ€™s total population is subscribed to the New York Times. How can the New York Times increase their number of New York subscribers? 

Some assumptions are made in the problem above: 

- I do not actually know how many New Yorkers are subscribed to the New York Times 
- I do know that the New York Times has a New York column that targets New Yorkers
- I can help the New York Times better understand the New York market so they can personalized outreach campaigns to their intended market and increase readership

### Impact Hypothesis: By understanding the demographic, social, housing, and economic characteristics of New Yorkers, the New York Times can implement personalized outreach campaigns to segmented groups in order to increase the New York column readership.

### Dataset: Location, Income, Industry, Age, Ethnicity, Education Data from American Community Survey 5-Year (2009-2019)


### Preliminary Analysis: 

- How educated are New Yorkers?
- What are the age groups of New Yorkers?
- What are their income levels?
- Employed or unemployed?
- What industry?
- What are their ethnicities?

Many New Yorkers are within the ages of 18-60.  

### Solution Path 1:

Interpretive 
Logistic regression to see what features inform of a likely subscriber 
The New York Times should see an increase in subscribers as they focus on New Yorkers who are likely to subscribe
The model is predicting accurately on a test set

### Solution Path 2: 

Unsupervised clustering to group New Yorkers into likely to subscribe and unlikely to subscribe groups and to better cater to target groups. 
The New York Times should see an increase in subscribers as they focus on relevant messaging to potential subscribers
The clustering is accurately grouping New Yorkers and identifying target groups for New York Times to promote relevant messages
